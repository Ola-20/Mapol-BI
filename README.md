Mapol is a tech company that produces hardware, distribute to different customers, from where products get sold to consumers all over the world
Mapol also sells these products directly from their online and physical sales platform. 
In addition, they sell products to distributors in some country where sales to customer is either prohibited or not advantageous.
Considering this complex environment, mapol has recorded huge loss while trying to expand to some other market (North America) because they made business decisions
based on surveys and intuition, therefore they decided to onboard data analytics to increase transparency and guide proper decision 
making across board in their organisation hoping to increase business profit thereby. 

The analyst team will provide an interactive dashboard that will allow different departments get respective related insight and thus make data driven decisions
